# tweegeemee

A Clojure library designed to breed images via twitter.

See https://twitter.com/tweegeemee/media for the latest images.

So far, I'm using https://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1, http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph91.html, https://github.com/nodename/clevolution, https://github.com/mikera/clisk, http://www.thattommyhall.com/2013/08/23/genetic-programming-in-clojure-with-zippers/ and http://blog.raynes.me/blog/2011/12/02/waving-our-tentacles/ for ideas.
