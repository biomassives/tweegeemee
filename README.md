# tweegeemee

A Clojure library designed to breed images via twitter.

So far, I'm using https://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1, http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph91.html, https://github.com/nodename/clevolution, https://github.com/mikera/clisk, http://www.thattommyhall.com/2013/08/23/genetic-programming-in-clojure-with-zippers/ for ideas.

## To Do

* [-] create images
** [x] show images
** [x] allow for errors during creation
** [] check that image isn't just black
** [] save image as file
* [] post images
* [] read twitter favorites & retweets
* [] breed new images
